Wanna know about me in-depth...<br>



***It's not all about Christo John but a lot about Tesnic as well***<br><br><br>
***Hello*** **Boss,**

 > Wanna know about me... Then you are at the right place...

My name is Christo John, from the land of kerala - **The Gods Own country**....<br>
Aged 18 as of may 12 2022... And a BCA student at that...<br>

I am a computer aspirant and programmer along with basic IoT, Arduino and NodeMCU development as side business (Not really though):>>...<br>
It was my biggest dream to learn about hardware and software technologies to its root...<br><br>
<section>
<img src="./assets\Interested.jpg" width='300' height='150'> 



#  Interests

I am interested in a lot of stuffs, though yet not defined them all properly but surely am intersted in the field of Computer Technology - both Hardware and software -...<br>
Also am interested in the field of agriculture as I am rooted from an agricultural family.<br>
Along with that I am very much fond of anime, manga and of course manga novels :):) ...<br><br><br>

</section>

# 💭 Dreams

As same as my Interests I have a lot of undefined dreams. 


***At present  my dream is to become a computer expert where I am capable of defining a computer upto its roof to root and could understand it completely both in terms of Hardware and software technologies ---- pretty fancy ha... >>***<br><br>
As for my biggest dream, ***It is to create a completely free  and open-source world where anyone could find anything which they are interested inrsrearch on it completely out of bounds as well as for free as well as get hands-on-experience including practical experience absolutely free *-Well, that seems super fancy and impossible... But yet it's not ...-*<br><br><br>


# 💥 Programmer | Designer | Developer
<br><br>

Well, I would introduce myself as a programmer, designer and a developer. Its because I am...<br><br>

> 🧾 As a programmer,<br>
I am capable of handling mid level C as well as basic level java and some node.js in terms of software programming...<br>
In terms of hardware programming I am pretty much capable of handling Arduino, NodeMCU development boards and could handle some basic level IoT projects...<br><br>

> 👨‍💻 As a designer,<br>
Well as a designer I am capable of handling some graphic designing softwares as well as typographic designing (primarily fontLab and fontForge)<br>
And as well as I could design some no code websites.. Well of course I have a website for real as well as a website is being under designing for my brand name **TESNIC** and soon will be released for real...!<br><br>

> 📀 As a developer<br>
Aand of course as a developer I could handle Arduino, NodeMCU, IoT projects development and as well as am currently a telegram bot designer and developer....<br>
Yes of course I am a telegram bot develooer...**TESNICO** is my primary bot's name -Which was of course derived from **Tesnic**... Tesnico is currently 7under development as of 10 04 2023(today) and am not 24/7 online... It is locally hosted and not in any clouds.... But Tesnico's source code and files are publically available at my Tesnico repo...<br><br>


<img src="./assets\rolemodel.jpg" width='300' height='150'> 

# Role model<br>
If you ask me who my role model is, then the answer definitely will be ***NIKOLA TESLA***!, <img src="./assets\nikolatesla.jpg" width='30' height='20'>   and that certainly is not out of neither empathy nor symathy but completely outta ***RESPECT!***....<br><br>

Nokola Tesla is the biggest scientist who had made 100's N 1000's of inventions, yet unrecognized... He was the biggest man who had always dedicated his whole for research and invention.. He was the man whose 68% inventions were used world wide... And he is the man who revolutionized the world with his AC current tech.. And who is there more worthy to be a role model✨️. <br> <br><br><br>



So basically that's all about me.... But well,of course its not all about me but about ***TESNIC*** as well...<br>
So what's TESNIC any way....<br><br>

# ⭕️ TESNIC

Tesnic is something more complex!but not either... It is just a simple name under I am releasing my projects activities and whatever I am releasing publically... It's almost like my brand name... Or a pen name... It represents myself and only me...<br>
Now then, where did Tesnic came from...<br><br>

Well, **TesNic** has  two parts as you see.. Tes and Nic... **Tes** as in **Tesla** and **Nic** as in **Nikola**... Yes of course TesNic is derived from **Nikola Tesla**....<br><br>

Why wasn't it NicTes then!  It's because I am a fan of japaneese contents... And in Japanese they say second name or initial or family name -whatever it is- as first name.. And thus Nikola Tesla became Tesla Nikola and thus TesNic **:]|**  ...<br><br>


What all do I have under Tesnic currently... Well currently only Tesnico is the only thing under the flag Tesnic.. And am working on a blog site which will soon be released for real names *TechNic* Which is derived from tech+Tesnic words...<br>
